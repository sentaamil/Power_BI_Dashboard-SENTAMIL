## 📌 Introduction

Power BI is a powerful data analytics and visualization tool used in industry to make data-driven decisions. This repository is a curated collection of my real-time dashboard projects developed as part of personal practice, academic work, and practical business case studies.

Each dashboard presents clear insights, key performance indicators (KPIs), and visually rich reports from real or mock datasets.
